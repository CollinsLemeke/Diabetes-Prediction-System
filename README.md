## Diabetes Classification using Machine Learning
A supervised machine learning project that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. This project uses classification algorithms to analyze medical data and identify patterns indicative of diabetes.

### Project Overview
This project implements multiple machine learning algorithms to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic using a dataset of medical attributes.
It includes:

### Data preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model training & evaluation

Accuracy and performance metrics

### Dataset
The dataset contains patient health measurements such as:

Pregnancies

Glucose level

Blood pressure

Skin thickness

Insulin level

BMI

Diabetes pedigree function

Age

Each record is labeled as 1 (diabetic) or 0 (non-diabetic).

The dataset used is publicly available from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database on Kaggle/UCI ML Repository.
